# Working rules for this GHL (GoHighLevel / LeadConnector) workspace

Business context: **Mint Concrete Polishing & Epoxy** (Arizona, America/Phoenix
time). "Dan" / "Danny Carpenter" is the operator. Leads come in via SMS,
Instagram, and Facebook and are worked through the "Mint Concrete Polishing"
pipeline in LeadConnector. Quotes are often produced in **Jobber** (a separate
platform).

## Booking rule (hard rule — no exceptions)

**Never book, schedule, reschedule, or confirm an appointment for a customer
until that customer has explicitly said yes to a specific time.**

- Proposing a time is fine. Creating/confirming the calendar event is NOT — not
  until the customer confirms the day AND time.
- "Setup a time" / "get them on the calendar" from Dan is a request to *reach
  out and propose*, not license to create the event before the customer agrees.
- Only after the customer replies yes to a concrete slot do you call
  `ghl_create_appointment` (or reschedule).
- When in doubt, send the proposal, then wait for the yes.

## General

- Timezone for all scheduling and "today" calculations: **America/Phoenix**.
- Match Dan's texting style: short, casual, minimal punctuation, signs off "–Dan"
  when it fits.
- Don't send outbound texts/emails to customers without Dan's go-ahead on the
  wording (drafts first), unless he's clearly told you to send.
